# bad-sort

A tiny joke library that implements intentionally terrible sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms

- `stalinSort`
  - Sorts the array by removing any values that arent in the correct order.
- `sort1984`
  - The array is already sorted and always has been. Big Brother is watching.
- `bogosort`
  - Your classic bogosort. Shuffle array until it is sorted.
- `marxSort`
  - Sort an array of numbers by equally distributing the values for each array index
- `miracleSort`
  - Waits for a miracle to be sorted
- `nihilistSort`
  - Deletes the array because nothing matters
- `schrodingerSort`
  - The returned array is both sorted and not sorted until inspected
- `sisyphusSort`
  - One must imagine Array#sort happy
- `sleepSort`
  - Sort an array of numbers by sleeping using `setTimeout` (async)
- `gaslightSort`
  - Returns a sorted array and then randomly messes with your original array

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute with anything including documentation/code fixes or new sorting algorithms

## TODO

- Enterprise Sort
- microservices sort: make an API request to compare each pair of values
- observer sort: logging the array will show the sorted array but it will keep being unsorted (is this even possible with js)
